[Notes]

1. Not all versions of DOS 2 support hard disks. Using PC-DOS 2.0 or later is recommended.
2. Unlike most 8088 machines, the BIOS is configurable in this version.
3. If booted without a floppy in the drive, the system will attempt to boot from hard disk
4. Memory Test on boot can take a while with a 640k of RAM.
5. To check available memory, run CHKDSK in DOS.
6. Windows 2.1 386 will not work. Windows 3.1 onwards requires a 286 and 2 MB of RAM.
7. Despite the BIOS mentioning support for 1.44 MB and 1.2 MB floppies, it does not seem to be possible to boot off them.
