[8088] IBM PCjr

[History]
The IBM PCjr was IBM's attempt to make a low cost variant of the IBM PC, designed for gaming.
It was unsuccessful due to its poor software compatibility, limited expandability, and limited amount of RAM.

[Notes]

1. PC-DOS 3.30 is the last officially supported version of PC-DOS. Later versions may work, but will be limited by lack of memory.
2. The BIOS is not configurable by the user.
3. If booted without a floppy in the drive, the system will boot into BASIC. The only way to exit is to restart the machine by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete.
4. Although 86box supports 640k of RAM, only 112 kB is accessible in DOS.
5. To check available memory, run CHKDSK in DOS.
6. While the real PCjr can be equipped with a jrIDE card to use IDE hard disks, this is not emulated in 86box.
7. Changing the video card is not possible.
8. Some applications may shift the display slightly to one side due to unconventional use of the PCjr video hardware. Unchecking the Apply overscan deltas option accessible through the internal video’s Configure button can help bring the display back into position.
